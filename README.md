get_plot function plots the rank 1 approximation result from SSVD_numba function.
Inputs are: 
1. u, s, v = return values from SSVD_numba function
2. clusters= the vector of subgroups assigned originally. 
3. dismiss = index determined to be dicarded.
Output: The heatmap of rank 1 approximation.
Details can be found in section 5: applications to simulated data sets
